# EZPC: Simplifying Your Computer Choices üñ•Ô∏è

Welcome to EZPC, the product of an ambitious CapStone Project at Flatiron. Our mission? To make the process of choosing a computer system a breeze, all while allowing you a touch of personalization.

## üåü Key Features

Here's a quick overview of what you, as a user, can do:

- **Quick Setup**: Fire up the program by running:
  - `python app.py` in the `server` directory to kickstart the backend.
  - `npm start` in the `client` directory to bring the frontend to life.

- **User Authentication**: Dive in with Login/Logout options or sign up if you're new to the block.

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Answer a simple budget question and voila! Get system recommendations tailored just for you.

- **Customization**: Not entirely happy with a recommended build? Swap out individual components as you see fit.

- **Save & Retrieve**: Loved a recommendation? Save it for future reference.

- **Purchase Links**: Ready to make it yours? Buy your chosen system via direct links to manufacturers.

## üå± Future Enhancements

While EZPC is already a powerful tool, there's always room to grow. Some aspirations include:

- **Dynamic Pricing Scraper**: While a scraper exists in the current project, its potential remains untapped. The dream is to harness its power to reflect the most current prices for each component, ensuring you always get the best bang for your buck.
