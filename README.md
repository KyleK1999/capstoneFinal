# EZPC

CapStone Project at Flatiron, EZPC is a site to help users choose a computer system in the simplest way possible and letting users have some minor customization of their system.
***

A user can: 

Run and setup the program by running -
- python app.py in the server directory
This will start the backend 
- npm start within the client directory
This will start the frontend 
***
The user can Login/Logout, sign up for a new account, answer a question about budget to get recommended systems, swap individual parts in a recommended build, save a system recommendation, can buy via links to the manufacturer 
***
Stretch Goals: Adding a scraper onto the price aspect for each component, so the prices can be accurate to the website. Currently there is a scraper on the project but it is not doing anything, due to it being implented earlier in the project and not being viable for what I wanted to use it for.
